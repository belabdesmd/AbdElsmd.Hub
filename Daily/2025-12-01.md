# _Monday 01 Dec, 2025_

It all kind of started in 2024 when I applied for a PhD I didn’t even like, but I felt stuck with it because everyone already knew.  
Majid sent me a podcast about PhDs, and it mentioned **NP = P**. I had heard of it before but never really thought about it. I looked into what such a discovery could mean, and the idea of its huge impact—tech, strategy, all that really grabbed me. Since my PhD was in a similar area, it made me think, “Maybe this is a sign.”

I didn’t finish the PhD, which actually turned out fine, because working on something like that in a public setting would lose a lot of the privacy such a project needs.

The idea itself feels world-shifting. I imagined it giving the Ummah a strong advantage at a time when things are tough politically and economically.  
In theory, it could affect things like:

- **Cryptography**: breaking messages and passwords
    
- **Technology**: helping many fields move forward

I pictured a Muslim discovering something this big, fitting into the belief that the Ummah will eventually grow stronger and the world will hit a better time.
