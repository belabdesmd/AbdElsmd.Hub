- `el'Lhaya` are the minority and they don't have military, political or financial power so how could they be the reason we Muslim majority countries are undeveloped. These so-called Muslim countries are more secular than Islamic, they allow everything that is Haram and make Halal things harder. #develop/religion
- Let's assume Music is Haram just for the sake of the argument. Is it really that hard to stop it that you try so bad to discredit who ever says that it is Haram. If you can't give the benefit of the doubt and check the arguments of Music being Haram and get to a point you do mental gymnastics (being someone who isn't well versed in Fiqh or Language) to prove Music is actually Halal - then what would you do if you were told to do Jihad! #develop/religion
