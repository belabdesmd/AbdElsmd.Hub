### Stop Toxins once and for all

> Toxins are bad, and that's the most obvious thing ever, physically and religiously. What need to be specified is `how bad` they are, especially `Religiously`!


Toxins are one of `الكبائر` +  `ذنوب الخلوات` which means it is one of the `blockers of Rizq`. Here's why I somewhat sure about it being the major reason:

- ***The Prayer Incident***: One day on the prayer of Maghreb, It just popped into my mind and the Imam was reciting an Ayah about Rizq which I missed completely.

- I have ***NEVER STOPPED*** for more than `3/4 days` properly since I graduated. The only 3 occasions I stopped more than that (not because I chose to, it's only the environment/situation helping me) was:
	- On `Ramadan 2025` for around `6 days` and I still missed on `day 12` (starting `day 7`)
	- When I went to Morocco for `30 days` then for `40 days`

- `Since 2023` when I started praying properly, starting `May 2023` (After Ramadan), the lack of revenue problem started. It was because:
	- I am now starting to pray properly and both things can't match
	- The oath I made to Allah
	- Me believing properly in Allah - How can you believe in Allah and still do things you were told not to do & you cover them fearing people and not Allah.

- For `15 Competitions`, the only one that I got close was the `Qloo competition` where I ranked `top 10`. I made it within the `40 days` expecting the results to be around last `10 days` of the Vacation. Results got delayed until I messed up after coming back home.
	- ***REASON***: Me stopping wasn't for Allah, the environment helped me. That's a full proof of this issue being the cause of competition-failures and in general the no-revenue problem.

Just stopping is not enough. If not properly then I will eventually come back. I need a proper stopping reason and there isn't one besides ***Taqwa***. The solution is in the definition: `ذنوب الخلوات` means you stop because of people/environment and not for Allah. ***Taqwa*** enforces that you stop for Allah.
