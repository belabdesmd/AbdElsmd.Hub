### Stop Listening to Music

> Music is not a big issue in the sense that it can't be stopped. It can be and I managed to stop listening to music for months with simple mess-ups here and there because of TikToks/Reels (short videos with music causing earworms and seeking to listen more music). These are fixed via:
> 
> 	- Cutting TikTok/Instagram fully
> 	- `Later`: Start as mute and only enable audio when the video isn't an edit or a meme
