### Risq is from Allah

For the past 3 Years I didn't get any revenue, my mistake was looking for guarantee in the I way I work while [[Rizq is from Allah]]!

- [[Rizq is from Allah#Rizq DEPENDS solely on Allah|Risq DEPENDS solely on Allah]]: Establishing the principle

- [[Rizq is from Allah#How is this even Possible|How is this even Possible]]: Giving a rational explanation

- [[Rizq is from Allah#So why Work, Let's just Worship|So why Work, Let's just Worship]]: We still have to work because we are on this earth to work (سنة الحياة); Work isn't linked to results.

- [[Rizq is from Allah#Results are not Always 1 or 0|It's not Always 1 or 0]]: You might not get what you want exactly. It's not up to you, whatever you get is probably best of you.
	- (+) Besides that: [[Rizq is from Allah#Rizq is not Necessarily Money|Risq is not Necessarily Money]].

### Allah is the best of Planners

Rizq is not always 0 or 1, like everything else, nothing is to be received as expected. whatever you will get is better than what you expected because [[Allah is the Best of Planners]].

- [[Allah is the Best of Planners#There's No Randomness, Everything is Planned|There's No Randomness]] and everything follows Allah's plans and Allah's plans are perfect.

- [[Allah is the Best of Planners#If Allah Wills Something, it WILL definitely happen!|If Allah Wills Something, it WILL definitely happen!]] regardless of what you think will happens. And whatever happens is best for you

### Ask Allah

We have just established that Allah can grant you anything and everything you got now is from Him (for Example: Rizq) and that we should Trust Allah's plans so even if we don't get what we want it is actually best for us. But, we have to [[Ask Allah (Duaa)]]!

- In your pursuit to better the `Ummah` and make `Dawah`, nothing is impossible if Allah decreed it and no harm can come your way when Allah is protecting you.

### You should work to deserve acceptance

Until this point, I only focused on my belief in term of what `I WANT` and not what `I MUST DO`.

Understanding that [[Belief is Action]] covers the second part which is: `What I must Do`..

* These actions [[Belief is Action#Acting is a NECESSITY to show Belief|Are a necessity]] and you can't just live without believing or acting on your belief.

* Those actions are: [[Belief is Action#Focus on Ibadat|Ibadat]], [[Belief is Action#Avoid Mamnu'at|Mamnu'at]] and applying [[Belief is Action#Shape Perception around Allah|Perceptions around Allah in my daily life]].
