> Belief is the acceptance that something is `true` or real, even in the absence of `full proof`, accompanied by a mental and emotional commitment to that truth. It shapes perception, informs decisions, and motivates action.

- **Belief in Allah** (_Iman_) is not just intellectual acknowledgment; it is trusting in His existence, His wisdom, and His control over all outcomes.    
- True belief aligns thought, intention, and action: you **accept what is unseen, act in accordance with it, and rely upon it fully**.

### Acting is a NECESSITY to show Belief

You can’t negotiate this or simply choose to live however you like:

1. You won’t truly enjoy life without Allah’s provision; He can take it all away in an instant.

2. The `Akhirah` awaits, where rewards are infinite and eternal, and punishment is infinitely severe.

### Focus on Ibadat

Worship (`Ibadah`) is inherently positive:

- Some acts benefit your life directly (e.g., fasting) or the Ummah (e.g., charity).
- Some benefit you by keeping your heart mindful of Allah, giving life purpose. During prayer, you remember Allah’s greatness, seek forgiveness, and express gratitude.
- All acts open doors in this world (_Dunya_) and earn reward (_Hassanat_) for the `Akhirah`.

`Ibadat` acts require just 15–30 minutes of focused attention, a short time to disconnect from everything else and worship Allah properly.

- Perform worship on time, with preparation and presence of mind.
- Focus fully, this is not a routine task. You are standing before Allah, reading His words, and worshiping Him sincerely.

### Avoid Mamnu'at

By default, prohibited actions harm you. You must avoid them for the sake of Allah. Would you want Allah to witness you doing these things?

If you fear people’s reaction more than Allah’s, then ask yourself: `Do you truly believe Allah exists, or do you fear people more than Him?`

### Shape Perception around Allah

Worship isn’t limited to formal acts, your entire day can revolve around Allah through small, mindful actions:

- **Being Thankful:** Say `الحمد لله` after meals, after receiving anything good, or even when facing difficulties; every event carries lessons or hidden blessings.

- **Doing Everything in Allah’s Name:** Begin actions with `باسم الله`. If something turns out bad, Allah protects you; if good, He grants barakah. This acknowledges that nothing happens without His will.

- **Seeking Forgiveness:** We sin constantly, even in worship (not doing it in the best way possible). Regularly ask Allah for forgiveness, and sincerely repent for major mistakes or lapses.
