### Rizq DEPENDS solely on Allah

To say that `X` depends on `Y` means that if `Y` ceases to exist, `X` no longer exists.  
Our mistake is making `Rizq` (sustenance) dependent on things other than Allah
- **method**: “If I don’t do this job, I won’t earn”
- **effort**: “If I don’t work 20 hours a day, I won’t have enough”
- **people**: “If I upset this person, I’ll lose my income”

This mindset applies not only to the _existence_ of wealth but also to its `amount`: “If I don’t do `Y`, I won’t earn `a lot`.”

Once we understand that Allah alone provides, a few truths follow:
- If Allah is the Provider, then material limits don’t define what you can receive. You can be granted anything, at any time, by His will - not yours.
- Results are not bound to effort. One may work little yet receive abundantly, or work tirelessly and gain little. Sustenance follows divine wisdom, not human calculation.

### How is this even Possible

To make this idea more logically acceptable, let’s define the limits of our ability to plan and think:

- The factors we can comprehend are microscopic compared to the infinite variables of reality. Our minds are simple and linear — easily missing what Allah, [[Pillars/05 - Gnosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Alim - العليم|Al-Alim]] and [[Pillars/05 - Gnosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Qadir - القادر|Al-Qadir]], never overlooks.

- Inspiration is beyond our control. A single unplanned thought can appear and change the entire course of one’s life.

- Leverage exists. One right move can make a 4 hours work equal (or surpass) the results of a 12 hours of labour.

- People can receive wealth without work. A child born into a wealthy family inherits more Rizq than most could earn in a lifetime.

### So why Work, Let's just Worship

The mistake lies in linking the `necessity of work` with the `guarantee of results`. You work not because your effort ensures wealth, but because work itself is part of life’s divine order (سنة الحياة).

Your actions contribute to the balance of society; your work may become the means through which someone else receives their Rizq. Yet, even if you didn’t act, that person’s Rizq would still reach them through another path, for all provision is already decreed.

### Results are not Always 1 or 0

We often confine ourselves within the limits of our own perspective — focusing only on the few variables we can see. But reality holds countless others, often hidden and far better than what we imagine.

You might think, _“If I don’t get `X`, I’m doomed; I must have `X`.”_ Yet, when `X` doesn’t happen, life goes on and a different path, `Y`, appears. Maybe it’s not what you wanted, maybe it even seems worse at first, but it works. You adapt, survive, and eventually forget that X once felt essential.

In truth, `Y` may have been the better outcome all along — part of a greater plan you simply couldn’t see.

### Rizq is not Necessarily Money

Money is only a tool to `measure Rizq`, not Rizq itself. This becomes clear with a few examples:

- Two people, **X** and **Y**.
	- `X` earns `200k DA` a month but spends `150k DA` on medicine, transport, and doctor visits due to illness.
	- `Y` earns only `50k DA` but enjoys good health.
	- Both end up with the same quality of life: one through `income`, the other through `well-being`. So, `X`’s Rizq is his full `200k DA`, while `Y`’s Rizq is his `health plus 50k DA`. In reality, they are equal.
- If someone could live without needing `food` or `sleep`, even a small income would make them richer in experience than most people.

- A righteous spouse is Rizq.
- Good health is Rizq.
- Peace of mind, guidance, safety — all of these are forms of sustenance beyond money.
