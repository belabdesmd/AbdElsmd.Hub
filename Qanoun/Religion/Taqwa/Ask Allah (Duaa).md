### Ask Allah, Always

Allah has planned everything in advance. Whatever is meant for you will reach you, inevitably. Yet you must still ask, because asking is itself a form of worship. It demonstrates your belief that Allah exists and is [[Pillars/05 - Gnosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Qadir - القادر|Al-Qadir]], The Most Capable.

Allah, being [[Pillars/05 - Gnosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Alim - العليم|Al-Alim]] (The All-Knowing), already knew you would ask and has planned the path to fulfil it.

Ask Allah for everything, even the simplest things. Remember: you have no true control, Allah controls all.

> `Example:`
> 
> I have a monitor that often gets stuck in a reboot loop and rarely works. Recently, it completely stopped working.
> 
> On two mornings, I asked Allah to help me turn it on properly, and both times, it worked. On the day in between, I didn’t ask, and it didn’t work.
> 
> **Lesson:** Even for small, everyday things, asking Allah matters.
