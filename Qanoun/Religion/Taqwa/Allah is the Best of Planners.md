### There's No Randomness, Everything is Planned

Nothing in life is random. Everything unfolds by the will of Allah [[Pillars/03 - Osmosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Alim - العليم|Al-Alim]] (The All-Knowing) and [[Pillars/03 - Osmosis/Religion/Allah's Names/Al-Qadir - القادر|Al-Qadir]] (The Most Capable) and for that, He is `Khayr al-Mākirīn` (The Best of Planners).

Whatever comes your way is not without purpose:

- If it seems bad (and you are a believer):
	- It may be an (`ابتلاء`), a test meant to guide you back to the right path.
	- It may be a `عقاب`, a worldly punishment for a past mistake, better faced here than in the `Akhira`.
	- Or it may only appear bad: a hidden mercy, a lesson, or a redirection toward something far better.
- If it seems good:
	- Be thankful, but stay alert. Blessings can also test the heart.
		-> Sometimes, Allah grants `Dunya` to those He wishes to distract from `Akhira` (the worst kind of trial).


> Since everything is decreed by Allah, even the smallest `idea` or `inspiration` could be a seed of reality. Your duty is to act (to _lock in_ and stand on business) trusting that, whichever way it goes, **you still win**. Just do it.

### If Allah Wills Something, it WILL definitely happen!

- If Allah wills you to be harmed (and harm can be a mercy when your intentions are pure) then no one can prevent it. So: 
    - Speak the truth even if it leads to beating, jail, or other repercussions.
    - Act for the Ummah even if it risks your life.
- If Allah wills you to receive good, no one can take it from you.

> `Example:`
> 
> Mondays are usually special for me, I eat spaghetti for lunch (which I love), then relax with sunflower seeds while watching an anime episode.
> 
> One week, I ran out of sunflower seeds and couldn’t buy more. I asked Allah for a pack, but none came that day.
> 
> Instead, on Sunday night, we unexpectedly had pizza and I ended up watching the anime episode while eating it. The timing and satisfaction matched what I usually enjoyed with spaghetti and seeds.
> 
> The next day, Monday, I discovered we weren’t having spaghetti at all it would’ve been a missing experience. Even if I’d gotten the seeds earlier, I wouldn’t have enjoyed them the same way. That night, I still received a pack of sunflower seeds.
> 
> **Moral of the story:** What I wanted didn’t happen, but I received something better, and even more than what I’d asked for.
