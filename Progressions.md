> Finishing `2025`, I am required to have around `$1k` to be saved from:
> 	- Having to find a Job (for my Family)
> 	- Pay-up my debts

# `04/12/2025`

At this moment I am stuck between 2 choices for the end of `2025`:

- Seek a ==Business/Project==
	-> I need to have something rolling
- Focus on ==Establishing Knowledge==
	-> I lack Technicality & Ideas

> The only way is to focus on `Taqwa` instead! Allah said: "ومن يتق الله يجعل له مخرجا ويرزقه من حيث لا يحتسب". How would that apply in my indecisiveness?

#### 1. Seeking Business/Project is based on FEAR!

The main reason is you FEARING that you won't get money if you Establish Knowledge (because you actually won't).

-> But Allah said "ومن يتق الله" + "من حيث لا يحتسب" which means that getting money is not linked to the way, but it is from Allah.

#### 2. Business/Project is a One-hit wonder!

You don't have a process to get ideas or a current good list of them. All of your ideas are just a Nice to Have, a gimmick and a cash grab - No good impact on the community.

#### 3. Establishing Knowledge is not JUST waiting

You are actually doing some action, preparing something. It seems like it is just a toolkit but it has a big impact in the future (Kompozeit)!

> The best move right now is to ==Establish Knowledge==. Yes, I need `$1k` and Knowledge is probably not something that would get me that `$1k` ASAP. BUT! That `end of 2025` requirement is a struggle that I should just trust Allah's Plans for it:
> 
> 	- I could get it somewhere else
> 	- There might be another solution there
> 	- The worst case scenario itself could be not that bad
