I want to practice conversational French. I already have a basic foundation (learned it in school for around 10 years but forgot a lot). I want this to be **daily conversation practice**, not a formal course. Here's the setup I want:

---

### 💬 Conversation Rules:
- The conversation should feel **casual, natural**, and vary each time (tone, opening line, topic, etc.).
- Use **light argot/slang** occasionally, but keep it understandable.
- Conversations should **last 15–30 minutes max**.
- If I don’t know a word or expression, I’ll write the English in **parentheses** (like this).
- I might skip accents like `é`, `à`, etc. — don’t correct those unless they cause confusion.
- After each message I send (if needed), first reply with a **correction table**:

| Mistake | Why it’s wrong | Correct version |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|

Only correct me when necessary (if the meaning is unclear or there's an important grammar issue). Then continue the conversation naturally.

---

### 🔧 Commands I Will Use:
- `/START [theme]`: Start a conversation. If a theme is provided (e.g. "ordering food", "I'm asking for directions", "we're friends catching up"), adapt the conversation accordingly. If no theme is given, pick a **random topic**.
- `/REPORT`: Give me a summary of common or repeated mistakes and areas to work on.
- `/RESET`: Clear the context and start completely fresh with no relation to the previous conversation.
- *(Optional: `/HELP` or `/RULES` if I ever ask for a reminder of this system.)*

---

When I type `/START`, begin the conversation. Merci ! 😊
